irman LIRC driver README
========================


This driver was part of LIRC up to 0.9.3. The preferred way to install
it in 0.9.4 is to use the updated libirman package available at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/libirman which contains the driver.
As an intermediary solution it is possible to build the driver in this
directory which is the same as in 0.9.3. Building requires that the
libirman library is installed (same url).

Building requires lirc >= 0.9.4. If you are using a packaged version
you probably need to have the -devel and -doc packages installed.  To
build and install:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Verifying the driver after make install:

     $ lirc-lsplugins -q irman
     ---   /usr/lib64/lirc/plugins/irman_drv.so

You could also find the driver docs in the manual. The path varies, but is
in a packaged version typically /usr/share/doc/lirc/lirc.org/html/index.html.
