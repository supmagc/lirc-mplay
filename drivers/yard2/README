YARD2 LIRC driver README
========================

This driver used to be part of the LIRC sources. In order to improve
the maintenance, it has been moved to the YARD2 project. From 0.9.4
the driver is available at
https://www.assembla.com/spaces/yard2srvd/git/source.

As a transition step the same files are available here during the 0.9.4
cycle. These files are a complete lirc driver for yard2. Building requires
lirc >= 0.9.4. If you are using a packaged version you probably need to
have the -devel and -doc packages installed. Note that the downstream
sources at yard2 are preferred and will be the only option in next release.

To build and install the driver together with the support files:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Verifying the driver after make install:

     $ lirc-lsplugins -q yard2
     ---   /usr/lib64/lirc/plugins/yard2.so

You could also find the driver docs in the manual. The path varies, but
in a packaged version typically /usr/share/doc/lirc/lirc.org/html/index.html.
