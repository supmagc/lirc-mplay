The irlog driver simple kernel character, stacked on top of another
driver. It has the potential to log some driver operations before
handling them to a underlying driver.

The driver attached is a run-time parameter device_to_log, by default
/dev/lirc0.

The supplied udev rule can be used to set the permissions.

Basic usage:

	# cp 99-irlog.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
	# udevadm control --reload
	# udevadm trigger
	$ make
	$ modinfo irlog.ko
	# rmmod irlog || :
	# insmod irlog.ko
	$ ls -l /dev/irlog*

The test program provides some crude ways to write(), read() and ioctl()
the device.
